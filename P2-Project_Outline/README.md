## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I'd like to create a web app which replaces the spreadsheet I currently use for my sales process at work.  The app would be very useful during an initial consultation where we meet anywhere from my office to a local coffee shop.  This would be useful for my clients by answering the three main mortgage questions: How can I buy?  What can I afford?   When am I ready to buy?  My app would provide a loan worksheet to the client estimating monthly payment and cash to close.  I would also have a DTI page illustrating what they can afford. 
### Features

Users- my team will each have their own log in and client database
CRM - the app will tie back into my CRM system so that I can continue tracking my prospects after our initial consult  
Admin - There will be an administrative input page for updating loan calculations as loan types and products change and new ones become available. I need to make updating the worksheet a simple process.  I will only do FHA and Conventional loan types to start, but to be a fully usable app my team would need all of the loan types available down the road.
### Technologies
Java, Spring, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Less Annoying CRM
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to build a project from the ground up.  I am worried about the code that we were able to start with on persistent, I will need to do it myself on this project.  I will also need to do much longer forms than we have done in the past with somewhat heavy calculations for all the parts and pieces of the loan worksheets.  I am also very excited to learn how to tie all of this back into my CRM system.
